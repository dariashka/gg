            <h3>What made you smile?</h3>
            <p>It was an interesting session, learning a lot about the DCC feature</p>
            <br/>
            <h3>What did you find confusing?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Confusing documentation with confusing search. Cannot find docs using search because it is
                    prioritizing API results. I (Dasha) didn't know where to start.
                </li>
                <li>Not enough testing sample card details in docs and not convenient to use it
                    <img src="debrief-14/docs_sample_cards.png" alt=""/>
                </li>
                <li>In docs, DCC is mentioned to be used with off site payment flow, but we don't think that is correct
                    /
                    helpful, on the topic of test details
                    <img src="debrief-14/dcc_confusing.png" alt=""/>
                </li>
                <li>After transaction was declined (because of insufficient funds), the back button occur the error
                    <img src="debrief-14/back-button.png" alt=""/>
                </li>
                <li>Not sure if we have access to DCC feature or not (no information about availability in sandbox)
                </li>
                <li>Buggy payment instruments dropdown in Recomm
                    <img src="debrief-14/popup.png" alt="">
                </li>
                <li>Saved test payment card randomly shows two errors, seems like data is not reactive. It only happens
                    with this card
                    <img src="debrief-14/tokens_error.png" alt=""/>
                </li>
                <li>We cannot unselect force currency in DCC form
                    <img src="debrief-14/deselect.png" alt=""/>
                </li>
                <li>We had an issue to get the DCC popup shown due to enabled force currency
                </li>
                <li>DCC popup is not styled properly with the styles provided in configuration
                    <img src="debrief-14/dcc.png" alt=""/>
                </li>
                <li>On transaction view there is no gap between DCC and Sticky gateway pills.
                </li>
                <li> And on hovering the DCC you cannot copy anything, and the data (rate) is different from the data in
                    timeline - it's correct but confusing.
                    <img src="debrief-14/interaction_details.png" alt=""/>
                </li>
                <li>Segments are showing nothing. Feature or bug?
