            <h3>What made you smile?</h3>
            <p>Automatically shows payment methods once configured in Rebilly</p>
            <br/>
            <h3>What did you find confusing?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Clicking outside of dropdown causes it to show (possibly a label width issue) - create new
                    organization form
                </li>

                <li>Updating organization details does not redirect to the landing page</li>
                <li>It should be possible to invite people solely using an email address</li>
                <li>Inconsistent with the current flow - it should redirect to the all users page and display a success
                    toast
                </li>
                <li>API key is incorrect for the organization and the message was not clear</li>
                <li>Deposit property set form has a typo in the label and strange "optional" placeholders</li>
                <li>Confusing error message layout when using deposit sets</li>
                <li>The <code>colorText</code> variable seems misleading - it applies unexpectedly to not buttons</li>
                <li>There are so many bank transfers displayed (bank-transfer-1, bank-transfer-2....)</li>
                <li>Drag and drop in rules engine is somewhat difficult to use</li>
                <li>Not able to differentiate deposits only in the rules engine to reorder payment methods</li>
                <li>Cannot pay using skrill or bank transfer</li>
                <li>We could not find a way to test any payment method except payment cards, we found this documentation
                    link, and we followed it, without success:
                    https://www.rebilly.com/docs/tutorials/test-transactions#test-transactions
                </li>
                <li>
                    We could only find test card details, but not details for bank account testing, however we could not
                    get to inputting information for bank account, since it is erroring.
                </li>
            </ul>
