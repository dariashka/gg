            <h3>What made you smile?</h3>
            <p>
                It was very quick to set the Google/Apple pay up
            </p>
            <br/>
            <h3>What did you find confusing?</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    we saw 3DS screen when paying with Google pay - this should not be the case since we paid via digital wallet?

                </li>
                <li>
                    Opinion: this step does not seem needed, we could've gone straight to payment. (This was already reported and new deposit experience fixes it)

                <li>
                    Cannot see that transaction was made using Google Pay.

                <li>
                    We were confused if this topic applies only to Framepay or not? I think we can have clearer wording here.

                    Apple Developer program asks for an annual fee of $99. This is not mentioned in the documentation.

                    idea: we could perhaps link to testing guide if processor is test processor?
